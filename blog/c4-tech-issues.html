    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> The Problem of a skewed male to female ratio </h3>

<p>The other day, I went to Google Headquarters for a networking tech event. I noticed that at every table were men. Splattered here and there in scarce amounts were solo females. Here's a great article on how one female dev felt after over 15 years in this depressing environment. <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008216/tracking/minding-gap-how-your-company-can-woo-female-coders">The loneliness of a female coder</a> The internet, namely Wiki, has rumoured that in 2013, females made up of about 20% of all US computer programmers. Currently, Google has published that females make up 30% of their workforce. <a href="http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html">Google Diversity - not.</a>

</p>


<h3>The possible solution?</h3>

<p>Plenty ways to approach this. Personally, I think the best way is to create welcoming environments by keeping open communication and feedback. Perhaps encourage female to female and female to male interactions.
