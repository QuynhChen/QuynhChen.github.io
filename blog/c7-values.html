How can my personal values combat Stereotype Threat at DBC? 10/30/14

    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Values in My Bestest Moments. </h3>

<p> Challenges, Community, and Inner Strength.
</p>

<p> Each value above work bolsters the other. For some, challenges in isolation may work best for them. But for me, I need a community to make overcoming a challenging that much more meaningful. With challenges in front of me and a community on my mind, I can fully tap into inner strength, a strength that I can feel proud about for years to come. </p>

<p> In general, I try to live up to these values. Agree 5 (highest score possible). </p>




<h3>Advice</h3>

<p> I'm an attorney by day and programmer by night. (You may compare me to batman if you like.) So the last topic that someone asked me for advise was on immigration. But I'm going to have to refer that case out.
</p>

<h3>Values and Stereotype Threat</h3>

<p> When I think of my values, I feel centered. I know that <em>this</em> is how I operate internally. Whether it can help me mediate stereotype threat when I feel it is unclear. Entering in DBC is the <em>challenge</em> that I value. However, I currently do not feel the <em>community</em> just yet. To properly explain why the lack of community can prevent me from fully achieving functional value set that can overcome my enemies, I'm going to make up a game analogy.

<p> Let's convert my personal values into a game with three variables. Variable one (challenges) initiates the player's energy bar, variable two (community) adds energy to the player's energy bar, and variable three (inner strength) is the SUPER mode when the energy is full. When I'm in SUPER mode, I can defeat anything, including the dark warlord "Inferior." But when the energy is not being added to, I'm merely alive in the game of challenges. Not dead, not amazing, just alive in the game. </p>

<p> One can imagine that merely being alive may not defeat one as mighty and as consuming as the dark warlor "Inferior." So ultimately, I cannot confidently say that merely thinking of my values will mediate my stereotype threat if any will exist in DBC in the future.

<H5>Can you think of exercises to help you when you are feeling down at DBC? <h5>

<p> I'll have to see if I can get into SUPER mode by tapping into a sense of community. Because when I'm SUPER, nothing will stand in my way.
