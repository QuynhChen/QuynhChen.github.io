How to use a class in Ruby 10/30/14

    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3>What is a "Class" in Ruby?</h3>

<p>First of all, everything in Ruby is either an object or will yield an object. Classes are objects to be used to organize other objects and classes. These other objects are then <em>instances</em> of the class.
</p>

<p> Analogy time: There's a class of wizards. When we created this class, we can define a method to tell us that "It's a wizard!" that applies to all wizards. Then we create an instance of such wizard and call it Hermione, therefore, Hermione is an instance of a wizard. We can put <em> more </em> methods when we create her but because she called her a wizard, we'll get alert that "It's a wizard!" We could also create Harry Potter and add him as an instance of a wizard. He'll also get an alert. Let's do it!

<h3> Example: Let's create the Wizard Class </h3>

<p>To Create the Class:
<p> <strong>class WizardHere
  &nbsp def initialize<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp@alert = alert<br>
  <br></strong> </p> Be sure to capitalize the first letter of the name. Then, "Camel" it by capitalizing the first letter of each word after it, rather than using underscore. </p>

<p>Define Instance Method of this Class:
  <strong><p> def alert <br>
    &nbsp "It's a Wizard!"<br>
    end

  </p></strong>
  No caps and use underscore please. Once you define the method inside the class, all instances of the class will share this method. Don't forget to put an "end" to close off the class! </p>

<p>Create and call Hermione and Harry as an instance of a Wizard!</p>

<strong><p> hermione = Wizard.new </p>
</p></strong>
<strong><p> harry = Wizard.new </p>
</p></strong>

<p> the full code looks like this:
  <strong><p>

class Wizard <br>
  &nbsp def initialize<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp@alert = alert<br>
  end<br>

  &nbspdef alert<br>
    &nbsp&nbspp "There's a Wizard here!"<br>
  &nbsp end<br>
end
</p></strong>


<p> Call it!</p>
<strong><p>
  hermione = Wizard.new <br>
  harry = Wizard.new</p> </strong>

<p> Results: </p>

<strong><p>There's a Wizard here!<br>
There's a Wizard here!</strong><p>
