    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> What are Arrays and Hashes </h3>

<p> Arrays  are for a list of items in order. An array looks like this <p>a = [item1, item2].</p> <p> Hashes are for keeping PAIRS of information, so that one item references the other item. A hash looks like this <p>a = {item1: item1, item2: item2}.</p>
</p></p>


<h3>When to use array</h3>

<p>Use arrays to (1) keep track of lists of strings, (2) store references to items you are working with, and (3)iterate through groups of objects in sequence.
</p>

<p> The items are stored in Arrays in a numbered order. Where the first item is number 0, second item is number 1, the third is 2 and so on. By knowing their position in the array, you can write a function ask, what's the item in position number 4?
</p>

<p> In addition, arrays can store any Ruby object such as integers, strings or floaters. so it could look like <p> a = [5, "bob", 8.2]. </p>
</p>

<p> Lastly, to access the info stored in the array, the argument is always the number associated with the position. So if our list is a = [5, "bob", 8.2], then I can request for item 1 by writing a[1], which would give "bob." a[never not a number]

<h3> When to Use Hashes</h3>

<p> Like Arrays, hashes also stores items but they store items in a different way. First, you use hashes to store pairs of items. Second, you cannot use Hash to put the items in order.
</p>

<p> First, why do we want to store items in pairs? When we assign pairs, they become linked. So now we can ask for one, we get the linked info. The most common way to use hashes are menu. You know what you want to eat but don't know the pricing. We can ask for the food in the hash and we get back the price. So if the hash is: <p> a {"fries": 2, "burger":5, "love": "priceless"}</p><p> I can ask the matching number (assuming I plugged in the number to mean price) to burger. <p> a["burger"]</p> You will get 5.
</p>

<p> Second, you can't use Hash to put the list in consecutive order. Unlike array's consecutive numbering scheme based on the item's position in the array, the hash is a bag of info. So if you want to know exactly where an item is, go use arrays.
