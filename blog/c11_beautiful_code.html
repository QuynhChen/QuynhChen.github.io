    Beautiful Code...I saw it...

    <div id="intro">
In my obssession to cram more code in my head, I encountered THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CODE.
    </div>

    <h3> What happened? How did you stumble upon this experience?</h3>

<p> Well, I haven't slept very much these past few days... and tonight, I really wanted to pair with K again. She has an exceptional way of teaching Ruby. Where... I <em> feel good. Real Gooooood. </em> </p>

<p>I didn't know what to expect. From her... or from my mushy brain. I was so delirious in my quest for more knowledge today, that I can't tell Composition from Inheritance... not surprising except my words were: "It's <strong> composition </strong> right here where the "<" sign is showing how this class is <strong> inheriting </strong> from the parent class."Yea... no... replace above word "composition" with the obvious choice: "inheritance"... </p>

<p>But tonight. Despite the mushy. I stumbled upon a beauty.</p>

<h3> Beautiful Code</h3>

<p>It reads like English. I might be delirious but it really reads like English. </p>

<p>It has single responsibilities with proper names. One method does one thing that makes sense!</p>

<p>NO REPEATS.. I mean... that's just... I don't know... great. </p>

<h3> NEXT: add more stuff!!!!!   </h3>

<p>gAWWD it's Beautiful. I hope to add stuff on my own and still maintain its beauty. I'd hate to mar such smooth flow.</p>

<h3> CHANGED EXPECTATIONS</h3>
<p>I joined DBC to learn code. I expected to learn and I still expect to learn. even more.</p>
