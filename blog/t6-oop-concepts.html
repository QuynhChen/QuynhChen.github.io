Inheritance vs Composition 10/24/14

    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> What is Ruby inheritance?</h3>

<p>Ruby inheritance is a relationship between two classes. One is the parent, the other is the child. The child class “inherits” any methods and constants from the parent class. The result is that the child class acquire the methods defined in the superclass.
</p>

<p>
class Mammals <br>
&nbsp; attr_accessor :hair<br>
end <br>
<br>
class Bears < Mammals<br>
&nbsp;attr_accessor :claws<br>
end
</p>

<p> Here, the class Bears would have it's own method called "claws" built into the class Bears. In addition, it would inherent all the class Mammals attributes. Here the attribute in Mammals is a method named "hair." So class Bear also has the method "hair." The reverse is not true: class Mammals cannot access the method "claws".

<h3>What is composition? </h3>

<p>Traditional composition involves moving those features that we want to share into a class in their own right.
