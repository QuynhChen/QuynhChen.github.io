<h3> Phase 0 Biggest Struggle: Time </h3>

<p>My urge to experiment with new information is too time consuming. I have to remind myself time and again that my curiousity about the new toy must be tempered with the finite currency of time.
</p>

<p> DBC will be throwing a ton of info at their student, getting bogged down in the details or distracted by the next sparkling new object will be crytonite to me.

<h3>Growth versus Fixed Mindset: expanding my mind</h3>

<p>So far, I tend to go off on my own rather than seek help. I find I sit alone hitting a problem in many different ways and being creative. Sometimes, this work and I high five myself. Other times, hours have past.... then I ask for help... just to find a solution was only a comma or a hyphen away.
</p>

<p> To properly expand my mind, I think two or three minds are better than one. I need to seek outside input faster.
