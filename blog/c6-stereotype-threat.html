    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> What is STEREOTYPE THREAT? </h3>

<p>Stereotype Threat refers to a phenomenon when a person is at risk of believing and living out a negative stereotype about their own group. Some down sides to this phenomenon is that the person starts to underachieve at whatever it is they may be doing, due to perhaps self-doubt or inferiority complex. </p>

<p> For example, there's a stereotype that all Asian females can't drive, as a result, an Asian female may feel that they do not want to risk causing a car accident and would defer driving to another person, usually a male. </p>

<h3>My Personal ST</h3>

<p> Stereotype Threat or "ST" has been a part of my life since I was born. Born into an old fashioned Chinese family as a female fourth child, I was doomed to be useless from the start. My job in life is to stay put and stop causing people trouble (there's an assumption that I have started trouble already since... counter = 0. teehee...)
</p>

<p>I reacted rather well to ST I think. Not in the beginning of course. Over time, I make it a point to identify the internalized voices that explicitly or implicitly put me down. When I identify the implied ones, I navigate around them. Back in the day, I had to actively fight the explicit ones...
</p>



<h3> How to DEAL with Stereotype Threat? </h3>

<p>The best way I have dealt with ST is to think of them as STD's. Like STD, as long as you want to interact with people on a personal level, ST should be a risk that you are aware of and take steps to avoid. Here's my golden rule to avoid STs.
  <ul>
    <li> Rule 1: Don't go to bed with people you don't trust. </li></ul>
 </p>

<p>Form and build on each individual relationship that you can find. Whether you bond by cohorts, friendship, hobbies or internet chat support, work on it! Because in the end, the relationship you put the most work in will result in people you can trust. They'll tell you if they have STD and will protect you from it. I mean ST... ST.  </p>
