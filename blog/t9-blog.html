    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> What have I liked about working on my personal website? </h3>

<p>Control! I know exactly what will go in it and how it will look! unfortunately that's intimately tied to the challenges as well! </p>

<h3>What has been challenging?</h3>

<p> I have to decide on everything including the colors, the sizing... the look... argh... I super appreciate what talented website designers can do for you!!!

<h3>How to be a "Good" Programmer </h3>
<p> Today, I asked a very good friend (ios guy) the ultimate question: How do you know when you have become a <em> good </em>programmer? The answer was not single worded but I extrapolated ONE WORD out of the conversation. The code would look "Beautiful."

  <p> Beautiful code means that an average programmer can easily read and understand the intent of the code with minimal effort. </p>
  <p> So now, I should have THREE goals in my life. First, to be beautiful inside. Second, to be beautiful outside. Third, to create code that's beautiful too. Sounds like a journey already happening. Wish me luck! </p>

  <h5> The last section on "Good Programming" was not a part of the assignment but hey, it's on my mind! This is what blogs are for right? =D </h5>
