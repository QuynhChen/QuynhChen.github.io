    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> What have I liked about working on my personal website? </h3>

<p>Control! I know exactly what will go in it and how it will look! unfortunately that's intimately tied to the challenges as well! </p>

<h3>What has been challenging?</h3>

<p> I have to decide on everything including the colors, the sizing... the look... argh... I super appreciate what talented website designers can do for you!!!
