    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Good question?  </h3>

<p>Bad questions are questions that do not clearly outline the specific problem. I've asked plenty of bad questions. For example, I've asked questions like: "I'm having trouble with ruby... can you fix it?" Or "How do I .length?"  For the .length question, I think it could be improved by pointing the language, then the class that the method is to be worked on. And if possible, what my final goal was: "In Ruby, how do you use #length on an integer?"  </p>


<h3>Good questions are maps</h3>

<p> Tell the person where you're at before you ask a question. "I'm looking at js, in DOM, I'm trying to create a function that does this but I get an error that says this!"
</p>
