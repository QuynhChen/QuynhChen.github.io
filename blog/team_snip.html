    Meet our first project: Team Snip

At the end of 2 Weeks, I teamed up with 4 other newbies and created our very first app: "Snip!" 11/29/14

    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> What is Snip? </h3>

<p style id="snip">  <em>"Your code ... Snipped !"</em> </p>

<p>Snip is a solution to the mechanics of studying code.
</p>

<p>During phase 0 and phase 1, it becomes clear that we students type pages upon pages of code. And unlike English, code of a programming language and what they do are generally NOT self explanatory. The moment the code leaves our fingers and makes itself comfy on your screen, it seems to take on its identity. You might have an AHA moment, then take a much needed break to high five yourself. When you come back.... all the lines of code look the same... What the @~!#!~! Which line of code gave me that AHA feel?!
</p>

<p> If only you knew about Snip before you took that break!! A current solution today would be to create a cheatsheet. But that would mean parsing through days or weeks (or months... dear lordy...) of code and mine for the good ones. Then copy and paste it over to new page. Again and again and again. This is tedious as heck.

<p>Snip is the solution to studying code.
