    Meet our first project: Team Snip

    <div id="intro">
At the end of 2 Weeks, I teamed up with 4 other newbies and created our very first app: "Snip!" 11/29/14

    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> What is Snip? </h3>

<p style id="snip">  <em>"Your code ... Snipped !"</em> </p>

<p>Snip is a solution to the mechanics of studying code.
</p>

<p>During phase 0 and phase 1, it becomes clear that we students type pages upon pages of code. And unlike English, code of a programming language and its function are NOT usually self explanatory. The moment the code leave our fingers and make themself comfy onscreen, they blend in and become camouflaged. <p> Let's say, after 2 hrs of typing 10 scrolls of code, you had an orgasmic AHA moment where you are f*ing LOVING your code here, here and... here. So of course, you high five yourself by taking a much needed break to release your neglected bladder. When you come back.... all the lines of code look the same... What the @~!#!~! Which lines of code gave you that AHA feel?!
</p>

<p> If only Snip existed before you took that bathroom break. A current solution is to go through each line and rediscover your AHA. (boring) <strong> Then you think: wouldn't it be thrifty if I CREATED A CHEATSHEET for assessments day with these AHA's? </strong> But that would mean parsing through days, weeks (or months... last months AHA's... dear lordy...) of code and then copying and pasting it to a new page...  I'm getting... sleepy... just thinking about it.
</p>

<p>Snip can snip that time & effort logarithmically. haHA! (Prove it you say?  =D  Next Friday, 6pm, you know where.)
</p>

<h3> How Does Snip Work?
</h3>

<p> When you have an AHA moment or your code is simply beautiful, you'll have the feeling that you should save it. When you get that feeling, type #< snip> before the code and #< /snip> after the code. Like this:
</p>

<p><em> #< snip></em><br>
  *code that you love*<br>
#<em>< /snip></em>
</p>

<p>Then at the end of the day or whenever, you just run the program on terminal: <br> ruby [snip program name] [file or batches of file to be snipped] <p>
  A file will automatically be created for you and all the little snips that you had previously inserted the "snip" tags on will be pulled into this file in a neat list. Every time you run the program, the new snips will be added to this one file. <strong> (Snip will check for duplicate snips for you.)</strong> Nifty huh?
  </p>

  <h3> Where do you see Team Snip heading?
</h3>

  <p> Snip 2.0 will be even better with the added functionality of titling and  organizing your code by its title category. It's gonna make assessment day a snip. </p>

  <p> We'll be sharing our code soon for your enjoyment! Just don't forget to leave a comment when you use it!
