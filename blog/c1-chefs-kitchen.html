    THE DBC EXPERIENCE

My interpretation of the DBC experience is that DBC exists to garner creativity.

Shereef describes the consumer mindset as a hindrance to creativity and limits learning. Consumer mindset is the idea that we sit back and judge a product, therefore we do not feel the urge to interact and make grand changes beyond criticizing from the outside looking in.

In contrast, he describes the Kitchen mindset that encourages creativity and the individual to take control of their own destiny. Kitchen mindset is the idea that everyone is contributing hands-on to create something yummy.



TODAY'S IMPRESSION OF DBC

I just started the DBC experience, so my impression is pretty limited, other than there's a lot of info scattered in many places. I haven't seen much creativity yet in prep phase but I look forward to it.

There's a DBC thing that sparks a bit of passion in me. I dislike DBC's integrity statement. Allegedly, I "fall out of integrity" if I don't complete certain assignments on time and they send you an automated email to tell you that you've "fallen."

The way I see it: I may be late. I may be slow, but I have not. not. not. fallen out of integrity with DBC. According to Shereef's ideology: To stop trying is to fall out of integrity; To not pick up that knife and cook is falling out of integrity; To not love what I do but settling anyway is falling out of integrity.

DBC may not say it but Shereef's video says it. You don't have to be the brightest or most experienced. Just keep trying to contribute and effect change.


HOW WOULD I ENGAGE?

I don't know.

There's a side of me that has millions of questions. Ultimately, I will need to learn to trust humans and time box. Because when I'm in the rabbit hole all by my lonely self, time is lost and I forget to find my way.


CHANGED EXPECTATIONS
I wanted to join DBC to learn code. I expected to learn and I still expect to learn.

EXCITED OR NERVOUS?
I'm excited. Very excited.
