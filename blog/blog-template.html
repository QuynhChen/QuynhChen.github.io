    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Ruby Enumerables: what is an Enumerable? </h3>

<p>In Ruby, an enumerable is known as a module. For all practical purposes, an enumerable can be thought of as a class of methods that have been pre-defined and built into ruby, that iterates throughout an array.</p>

<p> The class must provide a method #each, where the methods results in yielding successive members of the collection. If Enumerable#max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.</p>

<p> To see all the methods built in the enumerable module for Ruby in the command line, type in the terminal the following command: Enumerable.instance_methods.sort


<h3>Enumberable #map</h3>

<p> One of the methods included in Enumerables is called map. The map method creates a new array by modifying an existing array. The instructions on how to modify the the array is written in the block.The syntax looks like: original_array.map {block}
</p>

<p>For example: array = [1, 2, 3, 4].
  Calling the map method on this array would look like: array.map {|a|2*a}. Here, the instructions inside the block is saying: "multiply each object in the array by 2" The results would be [2, 4, 6, 8]

</p>
