    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Pairing </h3>

<p> At first, pairing was foreign concept, but now, I need it. I realized that my interpretation of the problem can be diverse and not diverse in a good way. I can a read a problem completely wrong at times when I'm reading it alone. When I pair find that I there's a better chance that we're heading in the right direction because we are each other's sounding board. I'm not saying that we would get it right 100% of the time, but it's darn closer than when working alone.
<p>

  The fun part is the back and forth sharing of ideas and creativity. There's always a short cut somewhere that someone knows of or something interesting that I never realized existed. So far, my partners have been either witty, funny and full of inspiring personalities. <p>

There are frustrating times of course when the solution or the problem itself is not clear to either of us. In those cases, we go into what I like to call the "Questionmark State." That's when both of us start saying things like 'What does that mean?', or 'that is kinda weird...." But being to say that out loud to each other is rather funny in of itself and relieves quite a bit of my internal stress. My thought bubble in my cartoon mind: "Phew... I'm not stupid, my interpretation is just 'divers' haha!" (It's a triumphant "haHA!"). </p>


<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p> I feel smart when I read my feedback!! There's so much love in the air! I'm like pumba singing "Can you feel the love tonight..." as I read the feedback about what had transpired between me and my partner. sigh... so wonderful... <p>

  <p> The feedback is not only helpful to keep me going when times are tough, it's also a stress reducer, which in turn keeps my mind open to learning! <p>

    Based on the feedback I've received, I need to pair MORE. I haven't done enough pairing. I'm also behind on my work! I also need to share my personal notes more. Apparently, the nerd side of me takes exhorbitant notes and someone I partnered with thinks they're actually useful! They are useful... but get in my brain already!!!<p>

    Writing feedback is pretty difficult... when I partner with someone, I really enjoy the back and forth. Finding something to improve on, however minute, is difficult for me when I enjoyed the interaction.... why fix something that isn't broken>???
</p>

<h3>Overall, thoughts on using pairing and feedback to guide your learning</h3>

<p> Pairing and feedback is a great way to learn. Learning should be with people! I dislike (almost to the point of hate) learning in isolation.... in my living room... all by myself... day in and day out... geez, what happened to the Socratic method of discussion among a diverse group of students. Where we foster ideas together... and be merry. </p>
