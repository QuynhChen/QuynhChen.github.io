    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Mock PHASE 1 Assessment: Did I perform well? </h3>

<p> <strong> <center>"Are you nervous about the mock assessment today?" </strong> <br> Me: "nooooo... it's just for feedback purposes on the first week and a half. nervous?...noooo..."</center></p>

<p>We're assessed in groups of three at a scheduled time. Our time was 11:15 am. At 11:15 am, the assessment room door was still closed. So we lounged around, chatting, jittery, and energetic ... <p> 11:30 am... We're getting nervous... we ask others who did it already about the difficulty level. Some said it was difficult, others: easy, some: don't know if they found it difficult or not... despite being there... </p>

<p> ... 12 noon... then 12:01... 12:02... one of us walks off... 12:03... 12:0...

<p> Door opens! The three of us shuffle in the assessment office. I tell a joke that M told me. ("why can't we trust atoms?"" haha, it's a good one. I promise. everyone laughed.)  </p>

<p> And then it was over. </p>

<p> What happened? ... well... for the first 5 min, my terminal returned <em> absolutely nothing</em>.

  <p>:> ruby #{filename}.rb <br>  #==>press enter <br>
  :> ruby #{filename}.rb </p>

  <p> Oh, I know what you're thinking. Yes, I put code in that file and yes I put "p" in front of my driver code and yes OF COURSE the file name was correctly and accurately entered. Nope, nada, not even an error. </p>

<p> So in retrospect... <strong> <center>"Were you nervous about the mock assessment today?" </strong> <br>
  Me: You're damn right I was.


<h3>Enumberable #map</h3>

<p> One of the methods included in Enumerables is called map. The map method creates a new array by modifying an existing array. The instructions on how to modify the the array is written in the block.The syntax looks like: original_array.map {block}
</p>

<p>For example: array = [1, 2, 3, 4].
  Calling the map method on this array would look like: array.map {|a|2*a}. Here, the instructions inside the block is saying: "multiply each object in the array by 2" The results would be [2, 4, 6, 8]

</p>
