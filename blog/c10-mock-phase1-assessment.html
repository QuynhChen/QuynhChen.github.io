    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Mock PHASE 1 Assessment: Did I perform well? </h3>

<p> <strong> <center>"Are you nervous about the mock assessment today?" </strong> <br> Me: "nooooo... it's just for feedback purposes on the first week and a half. nervous?...noooo..."</center></p>

<p>We're assessed in groups of three at a scheduled time. Our time was 11:15 am. At 11:15 am, the assessment room door was still closed. So we lounged around, chatting, jittery, and energetic ... <p> 11:30 am... We're getting nervous... we ask others who did it already about the difficulty level. Some said it was difficult, others: easy, some: don't know if they found it difficult or not... despite being there... </p>

<p> ... 12 noon... then 12:01... 12:02... one of us walks off... 12:03... 12:0...

<p> Door opens! The three of us shuffle in the assessment office. I tell a joke that M told me. ("why can't we trust atoms?"" haha, it's a good one. I promise. everyone laughed.)  </p>

<p> And then, next thing I know, the Assessment was over. </p>

<p> What happened? ... well... for the first 5 min, my terminal returned <em> absolutely nothing</em>.

  <br><ul>:> <br>:> ruby #{filename}.rb   #--press enter--# <br>
  :>  </p></center></ul>

  <p> Oh, I know what you're thinking. Yes, I put code in that file and yes I put "p" in front of my driver code and yes OF COURSE the file name was correctly and accurately entered. Nope, nada, not even an error. (And yes, dear Reader, I totally just read your mind.) </p>

<p> So in retrospect... <strong> <center>"Were you nervous about the mock assessment today?" </strong> <br>
  Me: <em> You're damn right I was.</em> </center></p>


<h3>BUT WHAT DID I LEARN?!</h3>

<p> ^_^ I'm not gonna leave you hanging. Here's what I learned.
</p>
<ol>
<li> <p> When the boss is firing coding instructions at you and your computer is not working (for WHATEVER reason), <strong> STOP ATTEMPTING TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE. SPEAK UP RIGHT AWAY. </strong> It's like a tadpole attempting to walk on land prematurely. Pathetic at worse. Cute at best. <br> Instead try saying: "Computer. Broken. Can't. Code. Help."<br> ("no legs...can't walk..."" get it? hehe.)
</p>

<li> <p><strong> Assessment is <em>not </em>the time to vent about stupid programmer's vocab:</strong>

  <p> Boss: "Given an array of hashes... return an array of student objects."
  <p> Me: "Everything is made of carbons. Technically you're just an instance of a Human that's made up of carbons... Yet I don't call you Human carbon. You have a specific name, so I use that. I call you Boss."
    <p>
    <em>(Sorry, here's a Translation (what I MEANT TO SAY WAS): <br>EVERYTHING in Ruby is an object. So something we create from an object is also an object. So when referring to an instance of a class, why do we call the instance of a class: a "class <strong> object</strong>." It has a specific name: "instance of class", so why not call it that? [it's ok if it still makes no sense...sorry.])</em>
    <p>
      Yea... just put fingers to keyboard... head down, run test code... save your wisdom for <em> after</em> assessment, right?

<li> <p><strong> Practice makes perfect! or at least makes you less fumbly fuddy duddy when nervous. </p></strong>
  With that said, see below (er... check back in a day...) to see the assessment questions and the answers. There's different ways to answer the same questions, so I'll try to display all of the possible ways. Feel free to test me on this after the weekend ==> <em>closed book like a Boss. </em>
