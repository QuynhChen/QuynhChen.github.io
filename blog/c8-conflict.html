    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Emotional Conflict Last Week </h3>

<p>I've had many big ones in my life time and they all would make epic stories to share. But being a rather private person, I will share one that is both a sensitive matter, yet oddly funny at the same time.</p>

<h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>

<p> My desperation triggered my dissatisfaction with my own learning progress. I cannot understand why he could not understand my desperation to learn outweighs his need for me to acknowledge him for his words.
