    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Emotional Conflict Last Week </h3>

<p>I've had many big Emo Conflicts in my lifetime and they all would make epic stories to share. But being a rather private person, I will share one that is both a sensitive matter, yet oddly funny at the same time.</p>

<p>I was trying to solve the Fizzbuzz problem. I think I actually did. But I felt at the time that it could be refactored more. So here I am looking for the ultimate method that would shorten my three line solution further... when my friend (IOS guy) sat down next to me and asked me what I was doing.
</p>

<p> In retrospect, I should have said "oh nothing." But I told him that I was trying to refactor. <br> He said, "Oh you can't refactor anymore." and I said "ok." <br> Then he said, "really, you can't. 3 conditions, 3 lines." and I said "ok." <br> then he said, "um.. you're not acknowledging me..." and I said "I am." </p>

<p> This conversation goes on like that for a minute or two. All the while, my eyes were on my screen... typing and reading on possible methods to combine conditions... Finally, he said, "you're disregarding me... here I am trying to help you ... and you're just writing me off because I'm the IOS guy."</p>

<p> At this point... I stopped typing. My mind froze and I had one thought... how did me trying to refactor suddenly an act that would personally insult my friend? The only way to acknowledge him would be to close my laptop and stop looking for my dream refactored solution... why would he want that anyway? </p>

<p> I closed my laptop. and said..."I do not accept the burden of eithr acknowledging or disregarding you just because you are IOS or not." "If the only way to acknowledge you is to stop looking, then I can't understand why you would want that. I'm gonna go... I have to pull myself together." Because at this point, what you (the reader) can't see is that my voice was trembling and I was close to tears. </p>

<p> I walked out of the room quietly, telling him as I went that I will be ok later, "I just need some space." </p>

<h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>

<p> I realize that I'm coping with a feeling of desperation that has been triggered by my dissatisfaction with my poor learning curve. This desperation is making me slightly compulsive with my research. In this case, it's turning me into an uncommmunicative introvert. I imagine myself rubbing my laptop, saying softly to myself, "my precious... my precious... they can't take you away from me... I won't let them..." Did I say introvert? I meant paranoid schizophrenic. </p>

<h3>My actions and what did I learn</h3>

<p> At that split moment when I finally heard his words, the only thing I was thinking was: why would he say something that would stop me from learning? I couldn't understand why his need for me to acknowledge him should be tied to me stopping research. But more importantly, why he would put himself ahead of my education?
</p>

<p>Of course, after I walked away quietly, I had some time to think. He meant well, just trying to save me from wasting my precious time.. time that's slipping away all the time.... Also, I think he just wanted me to truly reflect on what I was trying to do. Perhaps take a pause to talk to him and reflect, rather than stubbornly search. I do understand that at a certain point, I must pause to reevaluate my goals, especially, if someone sitting next to me was strongly advising me to do so.

</p>

<p> At my <strong>moment of tears</strong>, I'm glad I told him that I needed a little space to gather my thoughts. <strong> I'm grateful that he saw right away that he had hurt me somehow and allowed me to slip away. If I could go back I would not change a thing.</strong> We talked it out the very same day. I asked that it would be better if he used the socratic method and also point me pages to read regarding the exact point he was trying to make. Making ultimatum statements does not help me and they add stress... <br> For me, I need to chill out... take breaks and let it go when the brain has shut down... go do yoga or something.  </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
