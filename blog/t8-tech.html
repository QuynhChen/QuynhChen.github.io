    Dear Fellow Beginners,

<h3> Internet defined </h3>

<p>The Internet is a network of computers. So if there's a computer in a different country or whereever it is, it can connect to the internet. Each computer will connect to the internet with an unique number identification known as an Internet Protocol address. "IP address" with format ###.###.###.### </p>

<p> When the computer connects from a local area network (LAN), it is assigned a permanent IP address. The computer can also connect to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and be assigned unique temp IP address. </p>


<h3>computers talk to other computers via the internet</h3>

<p> Computers talk via the use of a 'protocol stack'. Every computer needs one to communicate on the Internet. The protocol stack is usually built into the computer's operating system  such as Windows. The protocol stack used on the Internet is refered to as the TCP/IP protocol stack because of the two major communication protocols used. This packet of information will be sent from one computer over the internet to other computers.
